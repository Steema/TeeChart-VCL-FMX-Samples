# TeeChart for FireMonkey applications

TeeChart for FireMonkey offers a wide range of common and specialized chart types, gauges and maps with customizable tools for data visualization to take advantage of the FM cross-platform UI framework. 

One of the many advantages is that TeeChart will scale and fit to any screen size. If you're building dashboards you can place multiple, resizeable charts on each dashboard panel, and FireMonkey will handle most of the variations for the different platforms.

This repository includes all the content and sample programs showing how to use TeeChart for FireMonkey applications.
