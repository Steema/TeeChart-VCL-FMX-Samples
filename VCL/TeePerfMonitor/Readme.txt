TeeChart Pro 
"Performance Monitor" example
-------------------------------

This example uses the conversion made by:

Marcel van Brakel (brakelm@chello.nl) 

of Windows Performance API to Delphi.

The demo shows one or more performance counters
as Chart Series, plotting values in realtime.

The Chart is a normal chart that can be zoomed,
scrolled, exported, printed, etc.

Counters have several options to control automatic
scrolling and removal of old points.
