## TeeChart Ring Buffer Series

This example uses a "Ring Buffer" structure to display data as fast as possible, as lines or points.

The ring (circular) buffer is just an array you can specify its type and length, and then just keep adding points to the buffer.
When the buffer is full, points will be added from the start of the buffer again.
